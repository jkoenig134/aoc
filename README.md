# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of daily [programming puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/) during the advent time.

## Prerequisites for running a solution

- dart is installed and in your path
- `cookie.secret` file is present in `_archive` folder

## running a solution

The input for your day will automatically be fetched for you when running a solution (format: `session=...`).

> example for day 1 2015:
>
> `dart run lib/2015/day01.dart`

## quickstart for a new day

- run `dart run _archive/daily_setup.dart` to generate the input and code files for the current day / year
- run `dart run _archive/daily_setup.dart <day>` to generate the input and code files for a specific day in the year (e.g. replace `<day>` with `5`)
